# June_13_BDTHackathon
## Hacking the hackathon - trying to reproduce the top results... 
### Objective is to maximize the F1 macro score. Two participants told of results of 0.92 and 0.75
### We're sceptical, our scores were a lot lower. Did we miss something obvious?
### Follow us while we chase the elusive ML tachniques that left us eating dust.
